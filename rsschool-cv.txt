At the moment, I am a 3-year student at the BSUIR branch of the MRK, majoring in information technology software.
I am engaged in Android development and I intend to become a full-fledged developer. 
I don't have much experience, I wrote term papers at my college, in general, I wrote 5 applications. I took courses on the basics of C++, C#, OOP, Java Core. 
Independently studied Oracle SQL, Git version control systems. I am currently actively studying Kotlin.
Let's go through my personal qualities: I believe that I am quite a sociable person, since I take an active part in the life of the college, 
I took the courses of the student asset “Leader” on the basis of BSUIR. I am stress-resistant, I quickly complete tasks that are my priority. 
I consider myself a multitasker, I can look at the problem from different angles, which leads to a more concise solution.
Among the disadvantages, I can note a low level of English language proficiency (A2). Lack of experience in commercial project development.
